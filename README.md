# bathroom-wall-webclient

This is a hacky/work-in-progress UI for [bathroom-wall](https://github.com/rasm47/bathroom-wall).

This project serves as a way for me to learn stuff by doing stuff.

Currently the UI looks for the bathroom-wall backend server at http://localhost:3001.

## running

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can run a localhost development version with ```yarn start```.
